# 9.3-Shooting-Gallery

In this lab, you will create a game using the Turtle graphics module. The game will involve blocks, players, bullets, and score updates.

## Game Description

1. Write a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics module to create a game where players shoot bullets to hit blocks.
2. Use classes to define the different objects in the game: Block, Player, Bullet, and Score.
3. Implement the game logic to handle player movements, bullet firing, block hitting, and score updates.

## Implement the Game

### 1. Define the Block class
- Create a Block class that inherits from the Turtle class.
- Define the characteristics of a block (color, position, hit colors, and hit count).
- Implement methods to handle block deletion and strikes.

### 2. Define the Player class
- Create a Player class that inherits from the Turtle class.
- Define the characteristics of a player (color, position, score, and controls).
- Implement methods to handle player movements and bullet firing.

### 3. Define the Bullet class
- Create a Bullet class that inherits from the Turtle class.
- Define the characteristics of a bullet (color, position, and movement).
- Implement methods to handle bullet movement and deletion.

### 4. Define the Score class
- Create a Score class that inherits from the Turtle class.
- Define the characteristics of the score display (position and player score).
- Implement methods to update and clear the score.

### 5. Implement the game logic
- Create a screen object and set up the game window.
- Create and draw the game border and blocks.
- Create player objects and bind their controls to key presses.
- Implement a game loop to handle bullet movement, block strikes, and score updates.
